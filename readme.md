## üß© Overview

Welcome to the **Python Blockchain from Scratch** project! This repository demonstrates a fully functional blockchain system, including:

- ‚õìÔ∏è Block creation & validation
- üí∏ Transaction management
- üîí Proof of Work (PoW) & Proof of Capacity (PoC)
- üßë‚Äçüíª CLI-based node operation
- üíæ Persistent storage (save/load chain)
- üìä Account balances & mining stats
- üõ°Ô∏è Chain and transaction validation
- üß∞ Extensible for advanced features (wallets, smart contracts, etc.)

---

## üì¶ Features

- **CLI Node:** Interact with your blockchain via a user-friendly command-line interface.
- **Dual Consensus:** Alternate between PoW and PoC for mining.
- **Balances:** Real-time account balance tracking.
- **Validation:** Full chain and transaction validation.
- **Persistence:** Save and load your blockchain to disk.
- **Verbose Mode:** Toggle detailed logs for debugging and learning.
- **Mining Stats:** See mining attempts, time, and PoC deadlines.
